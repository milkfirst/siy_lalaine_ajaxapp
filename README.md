# Earbuds Promotional Page

## :8ball: About

This project is a promotional page for Earbuds, where the goal is to create a dynamic and interactive website using various technologies such as SASS, AJAX, the template element, and the Fetch API. The page retrieves information about the earbuds from an API in JSON format and updates the view based on user interactions with the hotspots.

## :computer: Technologies

I developed this project using the following technologies:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- SASS
- Visual Studio Code

## Features

- Fetch API: Utilizes the Fetch API to connect with an API and retrieve earbud data.
- Template Element: Uses the HTML Template element to display materials and dynamically generate content.
- SASS Workflow: Implements SASS for efficient and modular CSS styling.
- Loading Spinner: Displays a loading icon to indicate content loading during AJAX requests.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handles AJAX request failures with separate functions for each stage of the request.

## Project Structure

- **CSS:** Contains the SASS files and compiled CSS styles.
- **JS:** Includes the JavaScript code for interacting with the API, updating the view, and handling user interactions.
- **Images:** Stores the images used in the project.
- **Index.html:** The main HTML file that displays the Earbuds Model Page.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Launch the index.html file in a web browser to view the Earbuds Model Page.
4. Interact with the hotspots to see the dynamic content updates based on the earbud data retrieved from the API.
